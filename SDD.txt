SCANNER 

* Definitions * 

ID must start with a letter, then it can contain either letters or words. 

Keyword must only be a collection of chars, numbers and symbols are not included. 

Numbers can be one of three categories: 
	integers contain only digits 
	floating point numbers contain digits and at most one '.' character 
	scientific notation numbers begin with a floating point number, then 
		an 'e' or 'E' symbol, a '-', '+', or '' character, and another int 
	The scanner considers any of these a NUMBER token. 
	
Other handles any situation that is not a word, number, or ID. 
	May be a symbol, or may be an unidentified TOKEN.
