Lexigraphical rules for a small C-like language

Just like Java, numbers consist of a string of digits alternately
followed by a period and more digits. Numbers may also have a
trailing power of 10 indicated by an 'E' or 'e' followed by a
+ or - or neither followed by more digits.

Similar to Java, identifiers consist of a string of letters or
digits, but must begin with a letter

Also just like Java, comments may be either // to the end of the
line, or anything between /*  and */.
